# Probability and Statistics - Problem Set 1

## Problem 1 - Basic probability
A photon detector can either record a photon (event A) or record nothing (event B) in a given millisecond.

1. If P(A) = 0.2, find P(B).
2. Over 1000 milliseconds, what is the expected number of detections?

---

## Problem 2 - Poisson process
Assume photons from a faint star arrive at a rate of λ = 4 per second.

1. What is the probability that exactly 3 photons arrive in 1 second?
2. What is the probability that no photons arrive in 0.5 seconds?

## Problem 3 - Gaussian errors
A star's brightness is measured 20 times. The measured magnitudes have sample mean m and sample standard deviation s.

1. Explain what m and s represent physically.
2. If brightness errors are Gaussian, what fraction of measurements are expected to lie within 1 s of the mean?

## Problem 4 - Linear regression
You are given a set of (distance, velocity) points for galaxies.

1. Describe how to fit a straight line v = H0 d using least squares.
2. Explain what H0 represents.

---

## Problem 5 - Hypothesis testing (conceptual)
You have two models for a dataset: Model A and Model B.

1. Explain the idea of a chi square statistic for comparing models.
2. Describe qualitatively how you would decide which model fits better.
