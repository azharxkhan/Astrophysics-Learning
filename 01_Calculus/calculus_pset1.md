# Calculus - Problem Set 1

## Problem 1 - Derivative as velocity
A planet moves along the x-axis with position
x(t) = 3 t^2 + 2 t - 5   (in AU, time in years).

1. Find the velocity v(t).
2. Find the acceleration a(t).
3. Evaluate v(1) and a(1).

## Problem 2 - Maximum height
A projectile is fired vertically upward with initial speed v0 from the surface of a planet with constant gravitational acceleration g.

1. Write the velocity as a function of time.
2. Find the time at which the projectile reaches maximum height.
3. Find an expression for the maximum height in terms of v0 and g.

## Problem 3 - Gravitational potential energy by integration
Consider a uniform thin rod of length L and mass M. Compute the gravitational potential at a point along its axis a distance a from one end by integrating contributions from small mass elements.

(Hint: set up the integral only if full evaluation is too long.)

## Problem 4 - Simple differential equation
Solve the differential equation:
dy/dt = -k y, with initial condition y(0) = y0.

Interpret this as a cooling law or radioactive decay.

## Problem 5 - Escape velocity via energy
Derive the formula for escape velocity from a planet of mass M and radius R by equating kinetic energy to gravitational potential energy. Show that:

v_escape = sqrt(2 G M / R)
