# Calculus Exercises

These exercises build skill with derivatives, integrals, and basic differential equations.

---

# 1. Derivatives

## Exercise 1.1
Differentiate:
1. f(x) = 3x^2 + 2x - 5  
2. g(x) = sin x  
3. h(x) = e^(2x)  
4. p(x) = ln(x)  

## Exercise 1.2
Use the product rule:
1. y = x^2 sin x  
2. y = e^x ln(x)  

## Exercise 1.3
Use the chain rule:
1. y = sin(3x)  
2. y = e^(5x^2)  
3. y = sqrt(4x + 1)

# 3. Physical Applications

## Exercise 3.1 - Velocity and acceleration
Given:
```

x(t) = t^3 - 2t^2 + t

```
Find:
1. v(t)  
2. a(t)  

## Exercise 3.2 - Free fall
An object is dropped from a height h. Assume constant gravity g.

1. Write the position function y(t).  
2. Write the velocity function v(t).  
3. How long until it hits the ground  

## Exercise 3.3 - Escape velocity
Using conservation of energy, show that:
```

v_escape = sqrt(2GM / R)

```

# 4. Differential Equations

## Exercise 4.1
Solve:
dy/dt = -3y,  y(0) = 5.

## Exercise 4.2
Solve the simple harmonic oscillator:
d^2x/dt^2 = -16 x.

## Exercise 4.3
A cooling object follows:
dT/dt = -k (T - T_env).
Solve for T(t).

# 5. Graphing and Interpretation

## Exercise 5.1
Plot the following functions by hand or with Python:
1. f(x) = x^2  
2. g(x) = e^x  
3. h(x) = sin x  

## Exercise 5.2
Plot both a function and its derivative:
Example:
f(x) = 3x^2 - 4x + 1  
f'(x) = 6x - 4  

Compare shapes.

# 6. Challenge Problems

## Challenge 6.1
Find the derivative of:
```

y = x^2 e^(3x)

```

## Challenge 6.2
Compute:
```

∫ from 0 to 1 of e^(x^2) dx approximate numerically.

```

## Challenge 6.3
The gravitational force is F = GMm / r^2.

Show that potential energy from r to infinity is:
```

U(r) = -GMm / r

```

This uses integration.
