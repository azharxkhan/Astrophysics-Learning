# Classical Mechanics - Problem Set 1

## Problem 1 - Circular orbit speed
Show that for a circular orbit around a mass M at radius r, the orbital speed is:

v = sqrt(G M / r)

Start from the equality of centripetal force and gravitational force.

## Problem 2 - Kepler's third law
For a planet orbiting a star of mass M in an elliptical orbit with semi major axis a, show that the orbital period T satisfies:

T^2 ∝ a^3

Outline the derivation using Newtonian gravity.

## Problem 3 - Energy of a bound orbit
Show that the total mechanical energy of a planet of mass m in a bound Keplerian orbit is:

E = - G M m / (2 a)

where a is the semi major axis.

## Problem 4 - Lagrangian for planetary motion
Write the Lagrangian for a particle of mass m in the gravitational potential of a mass M using polar coordinates (r, θ) and derive the Euler Lagrange equations for r and θ.

## Problem 5 - Non inertial frames
Consider motion in a rotating frame with angular velocity Ω.

1. Write the expression for the Coriolis acceleration.
2. Give an astrophysical example where Coriolis effects are important.
