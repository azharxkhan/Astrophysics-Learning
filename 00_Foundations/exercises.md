1. 45000  
2. 0.000032  
3. 780000000  
4. 0.00452  

### Exercise 1.2
Convert these to normal numbers:

1. 3.5 × 10^4  
2. 9.2 × 10^-3  
3. 1.1 × 10^7  

### Exercise 1.3

## 2. Units and Conversions

### Exercise 2.1
Convert the following distances into metres:

1. 1 AU  
2. 5 light minutes  
3. 2 parsec  
4. 3 light years  

Use:
- 1 AU = 1.496 × 10^11 m  
- 1 light year = 9.461 × 10^15 m  
- 1 parsec = 3.086 × 10^16 m  
- speed of light = 3 × 10^8 m/s

### Exercise 2.2
Convert these speeds into km/s:

1. 30000 m/s  
2. 1.2 × 10^6 m/s  
3. 4.5 × 10^7 m/s  

### Exercise 2.3
Convert these energies into joules:

1. 2 kilojoules  
2. 5 megajoules  
3. 0.8 gigajoules

## 3. Functions and Graphs

### Exercise 3.1
For the function f(x) = 3x + 1:

1. Compute f(0), f(2), f(5)  
2. Describe the slope  
3. Describe the intercept  

### Exercise 3.2
For the function g(t) = t^2 - 4t + 3:

1. Compute g(0), g(1), g(2), g(3)  
2. What is the minimum point of the graph  
3. Is the graph opening upward or downward

Given A = (4, 3) and B = (-2, 1):

1. Find A + B  
2. Find A - B  
3. Find the magnitude of A  
4. Find the magnitude of B  

### Exercise 4.2
Find the dot product of:

1. (1, 2) · (3, 4)  
2. (2, -1) · (4, 5)  
3. (-3, 6) · (2, -2)  

### Exercise 4.3
Find the angle between vectors (you only need the formula for now):

θ = arccos((A · B) / (|A||B|))

1. A = (1, 0), B = (0, 1)  
2. A = (3, 4), B = (4, 3)

## 5. Newtonian Mechanics Basics

### Exercise 5.1
A car starts from rest and accelerates at 2 m/s^2 for 5 seconds.

1. What is its final velocity  
2. What distance does it travel  

### Exercise 5.2
A stone is thrown upward with velocity 20 m/s. Ignore air resistance.

1. How long until it reaches the top  
2. What is the maximum height  
3. What is the speed when it hits the ground again  

### Exercise 5.3
A planet experiences gravitational force:

F = G m M / r^2

Given:
- m = 1 × 10^5 kg  
- M = 5 × 10^24 kg  
- r = 4 × 10^6 m  

Compute F.

### Challenge 6.1
A meteor is travelling at 35 km/s. Convert this speed to:

1. m/s  
2. km/hour  
3. AU per year  

### Challenge 6.2
Vector displacement of a spacecraft:
- A = (1000, 2000, -500)
- B = (-500, 1500, 1000)

Compute:
1. A + B  
2. |A|  
3. Dot product  
4. The angle between A and B  

### Challenge 6.3
Draw a rough graph (hand drawn or using Python) of:

y(t) = 1000 - 50t - 0.5(9.8)t^2

This represents an object thrown downward. Label turning points and direction of motion.
