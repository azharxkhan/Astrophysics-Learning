# Foundations - Problem Set 1

## Problem 1 - Units and orders of magnitude
1. Express the following in SI units:
   - (a) 1 light year
   - (b) 1 astronomical unit
   - (c) 1 parsec
2. Estimate how many seconds are in 1 year and write your answer in scientific notation.

## Problem 2 - Dimensional analysis
1. The period of a simple pendulum is hypothesised to depend only on its length L and the gravitational acceleration g.
   - (a) Use dimensional analysis to derive the form of T as a function of L and g.
   - (b) Compare with the known result.

## Problem 3 - Vectors in 2D
1. A star's apparent position in the sky relative to a reference point is given by vectors:
   - A = (3, 4)
   - B = (-1, 2)
2. Compute:
   - (a) A + B
   - (b) A - B
   - (c) The magnitude of A
   - (d) The angle A makes with the x-axis.

## Problem 4 - Constant acceleration
A meteor enters Earth's atmosphere with initial vertical speed 200 m/s downward and acceleration approximately 9.8 m/s^2 downward (ignore drag for now).

1. Write the equation for its vertical position as a function of time.
2. Find the time taken for its speed to double.
3. Find the distance it travels in that time.

## Problem 5 - Scientific notation practice
Convert the following to scientific notation and normal form:
1. Mass of the Sun: 1.989 × 10^30 kg
2. Mass of the Earth: 5.972 × 10^24 kg
3. Their ratio.
