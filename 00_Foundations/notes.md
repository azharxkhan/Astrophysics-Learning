# Foundations Notes

## 1. Overview
This section prepares the mathematical and physical base required for later study in calculus, mechanics, and astrophysics. The goal is to build comfort with functions, vectors, units, and fundamental physics concepts.

## 2. Scientific Notation and Orders of Magnitude

### 2.1 Definition
Scientific notation is a way of expressing very large or small numbers as:
a × 10^n

Examples in astrophysics:
- Mass of the Sun: 1.989 × 10^30 kg  
- Radius of an atom: 1 × 10^-10 m  
- Size of a galaxy: 1 × 10^21 m  

### 2.2 Rules
- Multiply: (a × 10^m)(b × 10^n) = ab × 10^(m+n)  
- Divide: (a × 10^m)/(b × 10^n) = (a/b) × 10^(m-n)

## 3. Units and Dimensional Analysis

### 3.1 SI Base Units
- Mass: kilogram (kg)  
- Length: metre (m)  
- Time: second (s)  
- Temperature: kelvin (K)

### 3.2 Common Astronomical Units
- 1 astronomical unit (AU) = 1.496 × 10^11 m  
- 1 light year = 9.461 × 10^15 m  
- 1 parsec = 3.086 × 10^16 m  

### 3.3 Dimensional Analysis
Used to check the consistency of equations.

Example:
Gravitational force: F = G m M / r^2  
- Dimensions of G must make the equation consistent with newtons.

## 4. Functions and Graphs

### 4.1 Functional Relationships
Functions map input (x) to output (f(x)).

Common forms:
- Linear: f(x) = ax + b  
- Quadratic: f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c  
- Exponential: f(x) = A e^(kx)

### 4.2 Plotting and Interpretation
Graphs show how physical quantities change.

Examples:
- Position versus time  
- Luminosity versus temperature on an HR diagram  
- Velocity versus distance for galaxies (Hubble law)

## 5. Vectors

### 5.1 Definition
A vector has magnitude and direction.

Representations:
- Component form: A = (Ax, Ay, Az)  
- Magnitude: |A| = sqrt(Ax^2 + Ay^2 + Az^2)

### 5.2 Vector Operations
- Addition: A + B  
- Dot product: A · B = |A||B|cos(theta)  
- Cross product: A × B gives a vector perpendicular to both

Applications:
- Force calculations  
- Momentum and angular momentum  
- Position and displacement in 3D space

## 6. Introduction to Newtonian Physics

### 6.1 Newton's Laws
1. Objects remain in constant motion unless acted on by a net force.  
2. F = m a  
3. Forces occur in equal and opposite pairs.

### 6.2 Work and Energy
- Work: W = F d  
- Kinetic energy: K = 1/2 m v^2  
- Potential energy: depends on the force field  
  For gravity near Earth: U = m g h

### 6.3 Gravity
Universal law:
F = G m M / r^2  

This governs:
- Planetary orbits  
- Falling bodies  
- Galaxy rotation curves  
- Structure of stars

## 7. Why These Foundations Matter
The ideas here appear everywhere:
- Calculus relies on functions and graphs  
- Orbits rely on vector motion  
- Star formation uses dimensional analysis  
- Galaxy structures use Newtonian gravitation  

Mastery of this section ensures smooth progress into calculus and mechanics.
