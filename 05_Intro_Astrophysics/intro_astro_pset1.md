# Introductory Astrophysics - Problem Set 1

## Problem 1 - Flux and luminosity
1. Define luminosity and flux.
2. A star has luminosity L = 5 L_sun and lies at 10 parsec. Compute its flux at Earth in terms of solar flux units.

## Problem 2 - Magnitudes
1. Explain the difference between apparent magnitude and absolute magnitude.
2. If a star has absolute magnitude M = 4.8 and is at distance 10 pc, what is its apparent magnitude?

## Problem 3 - HR diagram placement
Given a set of stars with known temperatures and luminosities, describe how to place them on a Hertzsprung Russell diagram and what their positions tell you about their evolutionary states.

## Problem 4 - Binary star masses
For a binary system with known orbital period and separation (assume circular orbit), derive the expression that relates the total mass of the system to these quantities.

## Problem 5 - Telescope resolution
Using the Rayleigh criterion, derive the angular resolution for a telescope of diameter D observing light of wavelength λ. Comment on the effect of increasing D.
